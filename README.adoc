== Building

You need SDL 2.0 installed. Type `make` to compile.


== Running

Run `derclou` to start the game.

Here is the command line usage:

....
Syntax:
        derclou [-h] [-d[<num>]] [-f] [-g<num>] [-q<filter>] [-a] [-m<num>] [-s<num>] [-t]
Flags:
        -h         - show help
        -d[<num>]  - enable debug output (debug level [1])
        -f         - run in full screen mode
        -g<num>    - graphics scale factor
        -q<filter> - scaler quality (nearest,linear)
        -a         - enable font shadows

        -s<num>    - sfx volume (0-255)
        -t         - trainer
....


== Implementation

The game autodetects the following data files:

  a. Der Clou!
  b. Der Clou! CD-ROM
  c. Der Clou! Profidisk
  d. Der Clou! Profidisk CD-ROM

PC version only.

It also autodetects the language: German/English/French/Spanish/Slovak.

The game tries to load the datafiles from the directory pointed by
  the environment variable `DERCLOU_ROOTDIR`.
  Failing that it will try to load them from the current directory.

The free datafiles (German) can no longer be downloaded from the neo website.
  The website has been down for some time. I put these files in a tarball here:
  https://sites.google.com/site/vascocosta/theclue

Just `cd` into the created directory and run `derclou` to play.

The English datafiles have not been released by neo Software since they
  do not own the copyright for them. Not that you should have much trouble
  finding them.


== Request

If you like this software please contact neo Software Produktions GmbH and help
me persuade them to re-release the source code under an actual open source
license like the GNU GPL. Be nice to them.

Enjoy!
